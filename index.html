                Madras Matinee” is a heartfelt, middle-class slice-of-life drama 
                that resonates with quiet realism and warm nostalgia. Directed by
                 debutant Karthikeyan Mani, the film weaves the story of Kannan 
                 (played by Kaali Venkat), an auto-rickshaw driver navigating daily 
                 struggles alongside his family, as narrated by a reluctant sci-fi 
                 writer (Sathyaraj) urged to write about “real people”

                Virumandi is a gripping tale of honor, revenge, and the 
                complexities of rural life. Directed by the legendary 
                Kamal Haasan, the film explores the life of a young man

                performances and thought-provoking narrative, Virumandi challenges
                societal norms and sheds light on the harsh realities of life 
                in rural India.<br>
                “Even in 2025, Virumandi feels ahead of its time… a surprise, raw, gritty, and unexpected for a 2004 film.”
                “A solid script with a touch of Rashomon effect executed with masterful acting & 
                brilliant direction… thought-provoking… challenges viewers to consider 
                the consequences of revenge and the cyclical nature of violence.” <br>
                One of the cult classics of Tamil Cinema. The dialogues especially are very powerful in this movie. 
                Kamal was at his very best…
